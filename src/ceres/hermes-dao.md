Hermes (HMX) is the native token of [Hermes DAO](https://hermes-dao.io/), a decentralized fund for investments in cryptocurrency assets (tokens, coins, NFTs...)
managed by the Hermes DAO Parliament and the community. 
The fund is primarily used for investments in existing crypto projects and projects in early stages.
It is an ideal balance between a hedge fund and high risk investment venture capital with constant and stable returns. 

# Hermes DAO Governance

[Hermes DAO Governance](https://hermes-dao.io/governance) platform is a tool for implementing the concept of decentralization in the Hermes DAO. 
Any Hermes (HMX) token holder with more than a set limit will be able to create a poll. Likewise, all voters holding Hermes (HMX) tokens above a set minimum have the same voting power. Each wallet's vote counts as one vote. This form of governance brings a greater degree of democracy.
